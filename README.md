* _In the Extraordinary Form of the liturgy_
   - Source: reading about Pentacost on Wikipedia, [this phrase appears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecost#Western_churches) in the description of Western churches' Pentacost celebrations. How did I even get here? I was listening (again!) to auralization "Teleutaion" ([hagiasophia.stanford.edu](https://hagiasophia.stanford.edu/)) and went looking up what "cathedral vespers on Pentecost" even means.
